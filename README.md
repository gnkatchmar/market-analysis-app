Assignment 13 due 8/8/16

Assignment for Class

Add some CSS flair to your vote tracking app. Add in transitions and/or animations to help the user know that the screen has changed. For instance, when images are removed, they should fade away, or move off screen. When the new images appear, they should fade in, flip, or move onto the page. When viewing the graph of data, the voting section should fade, reduce, or move away while the graph comes onto the page. Look for something that would help convey what is happening when the user takes certain actions.
